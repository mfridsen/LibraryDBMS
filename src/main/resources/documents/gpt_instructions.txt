To create a Library DBMS in Java and MySQL, you can follow these steps:

Set up the MySQL database:

Install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench (or any other MySQL client).
Create a new schema named 'library_dbms' or any other name you prefer.
Create tables for different entities like users, items, rentals, etc.
Set up a Java project:

Create a new Java project using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
Add required dependencies (JDBC connector for MySQL) to the project.
Create packages and classes for different components like database connection, models, controllers, and the GUI.
Design the database tables:

Users table: id, first_name, last_name, email, password, user_type, sub_type, allowed_items
Items table: id, title, author_director, isbn, genre, keywords, barcode, item_type, is_available
Rentals table: id, user_id, item_id, rental_date, due_date, return_date
(Add more tables if necessary)
Create Java classes for the models:

User, Patron, Staff, Researcher, Teacher, Student, Public, Librarian, Manager
Item, CourseLiterature, OtherBook, Movie, ReferenceLiterature, Magazine
Rental
Create a DatabaseConnection class:

Set up the connection to the MySQL database using the JDBC connector.
Provide methods for common database operations like insert, update, delete, and select.
Create controller classes for different actions:

UserController: methods to add, update, delete, and fetch users.
ItemController: methods to add, update, delete, and fetch items.
RentalController: methods to rent, return, and fetch rental records.
(Add more controllers if necessary)
Create a GUI using Java Swing, JavaFX, or any other Java GUI framework:

Design the main window, login window, and different panels for users, items, and rentals.
Connect the GUI components to the corresponding controller methods to perform actions.
Add input validation and error handling to the GUI.
Implement proper exception handling:

Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions like SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, etc.
Display meaningful error messages to the users in case of exceptions.
Test your application:

Test your application with different use cases and verify that it works as expected.
Fix any bugs or issues discovered during testing.
Document your code and prepare a user manual.

Following these steps should help you create a functional Library DBMS in Java and MySQL that fulfills the requirements
