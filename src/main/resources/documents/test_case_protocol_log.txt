Test case, test protocol, and test log are three different terms used in software testing.
Here's a brief explanation of each:

Test Case: A test case is a set of instructions or conditions that are used to test a particular software feature
or functionality. A test case typically includes a description of the test scenario, preconditions,
steps to be followed, and expected results.

Test Protocol: A test protocol is a document that outlines the testing process to be followed. It includes
a description of the testing approach, scope of testing, testing environment, resources required, and testing schedule.
A test protocol is usually prepared before the testing process begins.

Test Log: A test log is a record of all the tests that have been performed on a software system.
It includes information such as the date and time of the test, the person who performed the test, the test case used,
the actual results, and any issues or defects that were encountered during the test.

In summary, a test case is a specific set of instructions used to test a feature or functionality,
a test protocol is a document that outlines the testing process to be followed, and a test log is a record of
all the tests performed on a system.

A test protocol is a set of instructions or guidelines for performing a series of related test cases,
while a test log is a record of the results of one or more test protocols. A test protocol can contain multiple
test cases because it may be necessary to test a particular system feature or functionality using multiple scenarios
or inputs. Similarly, a test log can contain multiple test protocols because it may be necessary to test a system
using different configurations or under different conditions.
